## Chanllenge ‚ú®
This was my first time creating a MERN stack project, and working with MongoDB, connecting the server and client, and handling data flow was both interesting and challenging. I learned a lot throughout the process. Passing props between components and using session storage to temporarily save data while navigating between pages also posed some challenges. Additionally, integrating Stripe was tricky, especially displaying an image selected by the user that was stored on the server. Despite these hurdles, I successfully managed each step and gained valuable knowledge from this project.
